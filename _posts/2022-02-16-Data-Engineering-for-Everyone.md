## Data Workflow:
1. Data Collection & Storage
2. Data Prep.
3. Exploration & Visualization
4. Experimentation & Prediction

#### * Data Engineers deliver the correct data in the right form, to the right people, as efficiently as possible.

## Data Engineer's Responsibilities:
1. Ingest data from different sources.
2. Optimize DBs for analysis.
3. Remove corrupted data.
4. Develop, construct, test, and maintain data architectures.

## Big Data:
#### * **Very large data**
- You have to think about how to deal with its size.
- Traditional methods don't work on it due to its size.

### Big Data is usually categorized by the **5 Vs**:
1. Volume **(how much?)**
2. Variety **(what kind?)**
3. Velocity **(how frequent?)**
4. Veracity **(how accurate?)**
5. Value **(how useful?)**
