## What is Machine Learning **(ML)**?
Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence **(AI)** which uses algorithms & datasets to teach computers, mimicking the way humans learn, to predict future results.

## Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning:** Data is labelled/categorized.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Data is **not** labelled/categorized.
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Teaching a machine by trial & error, and repition.

## Machine Learning & Data Science Framework:

This is an iterative process.

1. **Problem Definition:** What's the problem?
2. **Data:** What's the data we have?
3. **Evaluation:** What's a success?
4. **Features:** What features to model?
5. **Modeling:** What kind of model should we use?
6. **Experimentation:** What have we tried/can we try?

### 1. Problem Definition:
What problem are we trying to solve?
1. Supervised Learning?
2. Unsupervised Learning?
3. Classification?
4. Regression?

### 2. Data:
What kind of Data do we have?
1. Structured? (Rows & Columns)
2. Unstructured? (Audio, Video, Images, etc.)

### 3. Evaluation:
What defines success for this problem?

Example: This model should have an accuracy of 90% at predicting prices of houses in a certain area.

### 4. Features:
What do we already know about the data?

Example: Using body weight, from a table of various info about patients, to determine if a patient has a heart disease. 

### 5. Modeling:
Based on the problem & data we have, which model should we use?

Using the right model for the a kind of problem.

### 6. Experimentation:
When testing model on data, success might not be achieved.

Repeat the 6 steps to achieve success.
